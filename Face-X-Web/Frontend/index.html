                <p>In this project, we aim to enhance face recognition capabilities through the implementation of diverse algorithms and frameworks. While numerous open-source face recognition frameworks exist, a comprehensive ready-made solution was not readily available. Consequently, we have taken the initiative to develop and incorporate various algorithms that enable frontal face operations. Unlike existing algorithms that primarily process high-resolution static shots, our implemented algorithms have proven to be highly effective.</p>
