The Inception V3 is a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks, which is used for image classification. The inception V3 is a superior version of the basic model Inception V1 which was introduced as GoogLeNet in 2014. As the name suggests it was developed by a team at Google.
<br>
The inception v3 model was released in the year 2015, it has a total of 42 layers and a lower error rate than its predecessors. Let's look at what are the different optimizations that make the inception V3 model better.
<br>
<h4>The major modifications done on the Inception V3 model are:-</h4>
<ol>
<li>Factorization into Smaller Convolutions
</li> 
<li>Spatial Factorization into Asymmetric Convolutions</li>
<li>Utility of Auxiliary Classifiers</li>
<li>Efficient Grid Size Reduction</li>
</ol>
<br>
The inception V3 is just the advanced and optimized version of the inception V1 model. The Inception V3 model used several techniques for optimizing the network for better model adaptation.
<br>
<ol>
<li>It has higher efficiency</li>
<li>It has a deeper network compared to the Inception V1 and V2 models, but its speed isn't compromised.</li>
<li>It is computationally less expensive.</li>
<li>It uses auxiliary Classifiers as regularizes.</li>
</ol>
