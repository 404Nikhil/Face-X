                  Despite a variety of open-source face recognition frameworks available, there was no ready-made
                  solution to implement. So In this project, all kinds of algorithms are implemented and even with
                  various operations can be implemented in a frontal face. The available algorithms processed only
                  high-resolution static shots and have performed sufficiently.

                the field of human activity recognition using wearable sensors. It provides an individual's valuable
                information regarding functional ability and lifestyle. Human activities are monitored automatically
                to provide personalized support to different individuals.

                  then match them against stored templates in a database.</p>

                  the social media platform and messaging app Snapchat unique and globally popular. Filters, or added
                  effects, can be applied over images in a variety of ways before being uploaded to oneâ€™s social network
                  for others to see. Geofilters allow users to alter a picture of a landscape, such as adding color to
                  sky or turning day to night</p>

                  detection cameras to detect people without a mask. App users can also add faces and phone numbers to
                  send them an alert in case they are not wearing a mask. If the camera captures an unrecognized face, a
                  notification can be sent out to the administrator.</p>
